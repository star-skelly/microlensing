# Microlensing Research Project
This project essentially generates synthetic microlensing data to use machine learning to characterize events and identify exoplanets.

## How does it work?
Still in very early stages, but the concept builds off of the idea of synthetic data to train models, which uses a teacher to distill into a student model that works with real world data.
